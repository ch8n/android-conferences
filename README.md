# asg-conf

A project to test out Jetpack Compose. This app pulls out conferences data from 
[this](http://androidstudygroup.github.io/conferences/) website and displays as a list.

### Objectives for this project
- Build a multi screen UI with Compose.
- Understand how state management will work with Compose
- Make app reactive to changes from network + DB as well as implement a simple UI filter
- Make it work with Flow/coroutines
- Keep it updated with `dev` releases of Compose

**Note**

This is an experimental project which will *probably* only compile with latest canary versions of 
Android Studio.
